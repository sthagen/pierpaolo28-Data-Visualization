# Streamlit
## Using Streamlit to visualize online Feature Engineering techniques <br>

Online Dashboard created using Streamlit. In this example, I used Streamlit to analyse online the [Kaggle Mushrooms dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pierpaolo28/feature-engineering). In particular, I focused on analysing how Feature Engineering techniques can be used to reduce the dimensionality of this dataset while preserving most of the embedded variance. Some of the techniques considered are:

- PCA 
- t-SNE 
- LDA 
- Locally Linear Embedding 
- ICA (Independent Component Analysis) 
- Autoencoders
